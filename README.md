Welcome to the Circle Chat! The Circle Chat is an online web-based chat application where you can chat with friends. The Circle Chat was built using <code>Node.js</code>, <code>Express</code>, <code>Sqlite/Sequelize</code>, <code>Vite</code> ,<code>React</code>. Using <code>Vite</code> and <code>React</code>, the user can login through the GUI and begin chatting with their friends! If you don't have a login, not to worry, because you can register on the home page! By clicking the "Get Started" button a user can either login or register for a user account. Using third-part authorization, all you need to do is login or register using your Github or Google account! Providing a quick and easy user experience!

The Circle Chat is powered by <code>Socket.io</code>, a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional, and event-based communication between client and server. With Socket.io, a user can send messages as well as store them so that they can view them later! The front end GUI was built out using <code>Vite</code>. <code>Vite</code> is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite consists of two major parts:

* A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement(HMR)
* A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to out put highly optimized static assets for production.

You can learn more about Vite and Socket.io here: [Get Started with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), [Get started with Socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/chat)
